Project Description:
===========
SaveDollars is an Android Application that helps users to compare prices across different eCommerce sites for
a given product. This can facilitate users to make smart decisions on purchase of the product. 
The application displays total price (Product Price Plus Shipping price), Product price, Shipping price and 
Availability of the product for different merchants (i.e. eCommerce sites). If a user is interested in a particular 
merchant, he/she can visit the home-page of the merchant by clicking on the merchant name. The application
displays the merchants in sorted order of the total price.

The product information can be obtained by scanning the barcode of the product or by entering the barcode number 
of the product.  Such smart comparision using our application will definately help you SAVE DOLLARS. 

The application is written in Java. 

We are using Google's Search API for Shopping. 

Note:
Zxing Barcode scanner's library code is not contained in the repo, but must be downloaded and set up following the
